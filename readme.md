https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329dceca-f1fd-472c-a3d0-30bb7f708fd3

## Features

- Music playback from YouTube
	- On-disk Opus file cache for subsequent streams
- Cached search powered by Spotify or YouTube
- Based entirely on slash commands
- Playlists stored on a dedicated channel
- Spotify-like volume normalization
- Recovery mechanism to continue listening after an error
- Redis-backed playback statistics
- Tic-tac-toe
- Integration with Sentry
- Extensive logging powered by Pino
- Easy deployment with a [Helm chart](https://github.com/xxczaki/charts/tree/main/charts/discord-bot)

## Deployment

You have two options:

1. Use the [Helm chart](https://github.com/xxczaki/charts/tree/main/charts/discord-bot) (recommended)
2. Use the Docker image from either [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/xxczaki/discord-bot) or [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/xxczaki/discord-bot/pkgs/container/discord-bot)

> [!NOTE]
> If you go with the second option, you will need a Redis instance configured with the `REDIS_URL` environment variable – take a look at the `.env.example` file for instructions.

## Development

First, install the Node.js version defined in the `.nvmrc` file and pnpm (ideally through Corepack).

```sh
# Install dependencies
$ pnpm install

# Start the bot in development mode
$ pnpm start

# Build the bot for production
$ pnpm build

# Lint, type check, and test
$ pnpm lint && pnpm tsc && pnpm test

# Test with coverage report
$ pnpm test:coverage
```

If you are using VS Code or a compatible editor, you can start the bot with a debugger attached using the `debug` task.

## Limitations

The bot was designed to be used on a single Discord server, on a small scale – typically on one voice channel at once. Therefore, it doesn't scale well horizontally.

## Versioning policy

- the Docker images are tagged with commit SHAs
- the Helm chart uses a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format where:
	- the `PATCH` increases with each Docker image update
	- the `MINOR` increases when other changes are made to the chart itself, e.g., when a Redis version is updated

## Stability

The project should be consider to be in a **pre-alpha** stage:
- frequent nightly builds are released
- breaking changes occur often
- existing features may evolve or be removed without notice

No timeline for an alpha/beta release is planned.
